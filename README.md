#Lost 'n' Found
Have you ever lost something. Wouldn't it be cool, if you could just search a directory and hopefully find it. That's what this app is all about. Found a lost item? Take a picture, describe the item and where you found it, provide coordinates and explain how the owner can contact you. Lost something? Search the directory of lost items, filter by your item type and contact the finder to arrange retrieval.
